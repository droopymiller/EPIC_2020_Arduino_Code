This repository contains code used for EPIC 2020. Any "Day_x" code for chromebooks contains
necessary libaries in the main file due to the lack of functionality of Chromeduino 2
(unable to add libraries).  These libraries are "pitches.h" and "SR04.h".
The "Servo.h" library appears to be included on the server side compiler.
